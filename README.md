# MyFirstOrchardSimulator 

My First Orchard is a children's dice game. The only decisions the game requires players to make is which color fruit to choose when a "wild" is rolled. I wondered what the probability of winning the game is, but I didn't feel like working out the math, so I wrote a simulator instead.
